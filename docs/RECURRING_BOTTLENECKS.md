# Recurring Bottlenecks & Resolution Paths

## The Cycle We Keep Hitting

### Bottleneck #1: Domain Restrictions (bramalkema.nl)
**What Happens**: 403 errors, Chinese/Dutch error pages, clasp push/deploy failures
**Root Cause**: Google Workspace organizational policies block external operations
**Why We Keep Hitting This**: We try automated testing/deployment without checking domain status first

**RESOLUTION PATH - STOP THE CYCLE**:
1. ‚úÖ **FIRST ACTION**: Check if domain sharing is ON (you've fixed this)
2. ‚úÖ **BACKUP PLAN**: Always have manual GAS editor testing ready
3. ‚úÖ **DEPLOYMENT**: Use `clasp deploy` (works) instead of `clasp push` (blocked)
4. üö´ **STOP TRYING**: External API calls, curl tests, automated clasp operations

### Bottleneck #2: MIME Type Issues  
**What Happens**: "Unsupported file type" errors for valid PPTX files
**Root Cause**: Typo in FileHandler.js MIME type definition
**Why We Keep Hitting This**: We test before deploying the fix

**RESOLUTION PATH - STOP THE CYCLE**:
1. ‚úÖ **FIX IDENTIFIED**: Change `openxmlformats-presentationml` ‚Üí `openxmlformats-officedocument`
2. ‚úÖ **MANUAL DEPLOYMENT**: Copy-paste fix into GAS editor (domain blocks clasp)
3. ‚úÖ **TEST AFTER FIX**: Only test after manual deployment complete
4. üö´ **STOP TESTING**: Before the fix is actually deployed

### Bottleneck #3: Testing Without Deployment
**What Happens**: We try to test code that hasn't been deployed yet
**Root Cause**: Assuming clasp push worked when it didn't
**Why We Keep Hitting This**: Not verifying deployment before testing

**RESOLUTION PATH - STOP THE CYCLE**:
1. ‚úÖ **DEPLOY FIRST**: Always ensure code is actually in GAS before testing
2. ‚úÖ **MANUAL VERIFICATION**: Check GAS editor shows the changes
3. ‚úÖ **THEN TEST**: Only test after confirming deployment
4. üö´ **STOP ASSUMING**: That clasp operations worked

## The Correct Workflow

### Phase 1: Fix & Deploy (MANUAL)
1. Identify issue (‚úÖ MIME type typo)
2. Manual fix in GAS editor (üìù Required due to domain restrictions)
3. Verify fix is saved in GAS editor
4. **THEN** proceed to testing

### Phase 2: Test (MANUAL)  
1. Open GAS editor: https://script.google.com/d/1feN12V9_9EgBR6lHIh1FcCRXJlT-w-uFEe3NYdN_AuaUiiWk0Ov8jICB/edit
2. Run `testOOXMLCore()` function directly
3. Check execution transcript
4. Document results

### Phase 3: Validate Architecture
1. Confirm universal OOXML core works
2. Verify PowerPoint-specific layer works  
3. Test end-to-end workflow
4. Document working solution

## What NOT To Do (Breaking the Cycle)

### ‚ùå Don't Try These (They're Blocked):
- `clasp push` - 403 Forbidden
- `curl` tests to web app - Domain restricted  
- API Executable calls - Domain/quota issues
- Automated deployment scripts - Domain blocked

### ‚úÖ Do These Instead:
- Manual copy-paste in GAS editor
- Direct function execution in GAS
- Manual verification via browser
- Document working patterns

## Clear Resolution Path for Current State

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **YOU**: Open GAS editor manually
2. **YOU**: Fix FileHandler.js MIME type (manual edit)
3. **YOU**: Run testOOXMLCore() in GAS editor  
4. **YOU**: Share execution results

### What I'll Do:
1. ‚úÖ Document the architecture (done)
2. ‚úÖ Identify the exact fix needed (done)
3. ‚úÖ Stop trying automated approaches (done)
4. ‚è≥ Wait for your manual test results

## Breaking the Pattern

### Old Pattern (BROKEN):
Code change ‚Üí Try clasp ‚Üí Get 403 ‚Üí Try workaround ‚Üí Get blocked ‚Üí Try different approach ‚Üí Still blocked ‚Üí Repeat

### New Pattern (WORKING):
Code change ‚Üí Manual GAS edit ‚Üí Manual test ‚Üí Document result ‚Üí Move forward

## Success Criteria

### We know the universal OOXML architecture works when:
1. ‚úÖ testOOXMLCore() runs without errors in GAS editor
2. ‚úÖ Creates test presentation successfully  
3. ‚úÖ Exports to PPTX blob successfully
4. ‚úÖ OOXMLCore extracts files successfully
5. ‚úÖ Modifications work (color changes, text replacement)
6. ‚úÖ Recompression works
7. ‚úÖ Final PPTX file is valid

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Architecture is complete
- ‚úÖ Fix identified (MIME type)
- ‚è≥ **Manual deployment needed by you**
- ‚è≥ **Manual testing needed by you**

**The cycle stops here. No more automated attempts until manual verification confirms the architecture works.**
