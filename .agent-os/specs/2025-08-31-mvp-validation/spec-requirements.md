# OOXML Slides Platform MVP Validation - Requirements Specification

## Overview

This MVP validation framework is designed to prove or disprove the core value proposition of the OOXML Slides platform: **extending Google Slides API capabilities through OOXML manipulation**. The MVP focuses on validating whether the existing codebase can successfully bridge the gap between Google Slides' limited programmatic capabilities and enterprise-grade presentation automation requirements.

## Core Value Proposition Validation

The platform's fundamental promise is to enable operations that the Google Slides API cannot perform by:
1. **Exporting presentations from Google Slides to PPTX**
2. **Manipulating OOXML directly with advanced features**
3. **Importing enhanced presentations back to Google Slides**
4. **Ensuring manipulations persist through Google Slides workflows**

## Business Requirements

### BR-1: Core Platform Roundtrip Validation
**Requirement**: Validate that Google Slides → OOXML → Google Slides roundtrip works reliably
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Successfully export any Google Slides presentation to PPTX format
- Process PPTX through existing OOXMLJsonService pipeline
- Import processed PPTX back to Google Slides
- Verify structural integrity and visual fidelity
- Measure success rate across 10+ test presentations
- Document failure modes and limitations

### BR-2: API Extension Capability Validation
**Requirement**: Prove that platform can perform operations impossible with Google Slides API
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Global Color Replace**: Replace hardcoded hex colors with theme colors (BR-2a)
- **Font Standardization**: Replace fonts globally across all elements (BR-2b) 
- **Theme Operations**: Swap color schemes or themes programmatically (BR-2c)
- **Custom OOXML Elements**: Add elements Google Slides API doesn't support (BR-2d)
- Each operation must show clear before/after visual differences
- Operations must work on presentations with complex layouts

### BR-3: Real-World Persistence Validation
**Requirement**: Ensure manipulations persist when users interact with presentations
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Manipulated presentations can be edited in Google Slides web interface
- Changes survive presentation copy/duplicate operations
- Theme-based color changes remain linked to theme system
- Font replacements maintain formatting consistency
- Custom elements don't break presentation integrity

### BR-4: Existing Codebase Utilization
**Requirement**: MVP must leverage existing infrastructure with minimal new development
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Use existing OOXMLJsonService for all OOXML operations
- Leverage existing extension framework (BrandColorsExtension, ThemeExtension, etc.)
- Utilize existing Cloud Run deployment infrastructure  
- Use existing test automation (Playwright, screenshot validation)
- Minimize new code - focus on orchestration and validation

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Extension Framework Integration
**Requirement**: MVP must use existing extension system for all manipulations
**Technical Details**:
- BrandColorsExtension for global color operations
- ThemeExtension for theme manipulation
- TypographyExtension for font standardization
- XMLSearchReplaceExtension for custom OOXML operations
- BaseExtension patterns for consistent error handling

### TR-2: Cloud Infrastructure Utilization
**Requirement**: Use existing cloud infrastructure without modifications
**Technical Details**:
- OOXMLJsonService for server-side operations
- Existing Cloud Run deployment (`ooxml-json` service)
- Current GCS bucket configuration for file handling
- Existing session management and signed URL system

### TR-3: Automated Validation Pipeline
**Requirement**: Automated validation of all MVP test cases
**Technical Details**:
- Playwright-based browser automation for Google Slides interaction
- Screenshot comparison for visual validation
- Programmatic PPTX structure validation
- JSON-based test result reporting
- Integration with existing test infrastructure

### TR-4: Performance and Reliability Baselines
**Requirement**: Establish baseline metrics for production readiness assessment
**Technical Details**:
- Processing time measurements for each operation type
- Success/failure rates across different presentation types
- Memory usage patterns during large file processing
- Error recovery and retry mechanism validation
- Network reliability testing for cloud operations

## Success Criteria Definition

### Minimum Viable Validation (MVV)
For the platform to be considered viable, the MVP must demonstrate:

1. **80% Success Rate**: Roundtrip operations succeed on 8/10 test presentations
2. **4/4 API Extensions Working**: All four API extension operations function correctly
3. **100% Persistence**: All successful manipulations survive Google Slides editing
4. **Existing Code Reuse**: 90% of functionality uses existing codebase
5. **Automated Validation**: All tests run automatically without manual intervention

### Failure Criteria
The platform should be considered not viable if:
- Roundtrip success rate < 60%
- Any API extension operation fails completely
- Manipulations don't persist through Google Slides operations
- Requires significant new development (>500 lines of new code)
- Cannot be validated automatically

## MVP Test Presentations

### Test Presentation Categories
1. **Simple Text-Heavy**: Basic slides with titles, bullet points, and simple formatting
2. **Complex Tables**: Multi-column tables with various formatting and styling
3. **Rich Media**: Images, charts, and multimedia elements
4. **Theme-Based**: Presentations using corporate themes and color schemes
5. **Custom Layouts**: Non-standard slide layouts and custom elements

### Required Test Operations
For each test presentation category:

#### Global Color Replace (API Extension)
- Replace all instances of hardcoded colors (e.g., #FF0000) with theme colors
- Validate that theme references are correctly established
- Ensure color changes propagate to all elements (text, shapes, backgrounds)

#### Font Standardization (API Extension) 
- Replace all fonts with corporate standard fonts (e.g., Calibri → Inter)
- Maintain text formatting (bold, italic, size) while changing font family
- Validate font changes across headers, body text, and table content

#### Theme Operations (API Extension)
- Apply new color schemes to existing presentations
- Swap between different brand theme variants
- Validate theme consistency across all slides

#### Custom OOXML Elements (API Extension)
- Insert custom XML elements not supported by Google Slides API
- Add advanced table formatting features
- Insert custom metadata or document properties

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Google Slides Import/Export Reliability**: Google's PPTX import may have undocumented limitations
2. **OOXML Compatibility**: Complex presentations may use OOXML features not handled correctly
3. **Theme System Complexity**: Theme references and inheritance may not translate correctly
4. **Performance at Scale**: Large presentations may exceed processing limits

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple presentations and progressively increase complexity
- Implement comprehensive error logging and recovery mechanisms
- Use existing Cloud Run infrastructure for reliability and scalability
- Leverage existing extension framework's error handling patterns
