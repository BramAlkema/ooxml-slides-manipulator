# OOXML API Extension Platform - Requirements Specification

## Vision Statement

Create a comprehensive platform that extends the Google Slides API beyond its inherent limitations, exposing the full power of the OOXML specification through simple, programmatic interfaces. This platform transforms Google Slides into a truly extensible presentation manipulation engine by providing **Google Slides API++** capabilities.

## Core Problem

The Google Slides API, while powerful, has fundamental limitations:

1. **Limited OOXML Access**: Cannot perform global search/replace operations across all presentation elements
2. **No Template Operations**: Cannot swap color schemes, fonts, or themes programmatically
3. **Restricted Theme Control**: No access to OOXML theme elements, master slide modifications, or advanced styling
4. **No Batch Operations**: Cannot efficiently process multiple presentations with consistent transformations
5. **Missing OOXML Operations**: No support for upsert operations, advanced XML manipulations, or custom OOXML parts

## Solution: OOXML API Extension Platform

### Primary Goals

1. **Universal OOXML Operations**: Enable operations that bypass Google Slides API limitations
2. **Template Management System**: Programmatic control over colors, fonts, themes, and layouts
3. **Batch Processing Engine**: Process multiple presentations with consistent, reliable transformations
4. **Developer Accessibility**: Make complex OOXML operations simple through intuitive APIs
5. **Production Reliability**: Enterprise-grade platform with comprehensive testing and validation

### Target Users
