# Agent OS OOXML Persistence Validation - Requirements Specification

## Overview

The Agent OS OOXML Persistence Validation framework empowers AI agents with confidence in OOXML manipulation operations by validating feature preservation through Google Slides workflows. This directly supports our core mission to "democratize enterprise-grade PowerPoint automation for AI agents" by providing reliable, testable assurance that OOXML transformations survive real-world usage scenarios.

## Agent OS Integration Context

This specification extends the existing Agent OS architecture:
- **Extension Framework**: Builds on BaseExtension and ExtensionFramework patterns
- **OOXMLJsonService**: Leverages JSON manifest system and server-side operations  
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Integrates with existing Cloud Run deployment and session management
- **MCP Testing Infrastructure**: Extends current Playwright-based visual testing capabilities
- **AI Agent Compatibility**: Provides structured APIs and JSON-based configuration for AI agents

## Problem Statement

Agent OS enables sophisticated OOXML manipulations through its Extension Framework:
- **BrandColorsExtension & CustomColorExtension**: Enterprise color scheme management
- **ThemeExtension & SuperThemeExtension**: Advanced theme and multi-variant theme systems
- **TableStyleExtension**: Professional table formatting and conditional styling
- **TypographyExtension**: Advanced font pairing and typography controls
- **XML manipulation capabilities**: Direct OOXML element modification

**AI Agent Challenge**: AI agents need confidence that their OOXML operations will persist through Google Slides workflows. Currently, AI agents lack:
- **Persistence Assurance**: Confidence that extension-applied features survive Google Slides operations
- **Roundtrip Validation**: Systematic testing of PPTX → Google Slides → PPTX workflows
- **Visual Fidelity Metrics**: Quantified assurance of visual preservation
- **Extension Compatibility Matrix**: Clear understanding of which Agent OS extensions work reliably in production scenarios

**Enterprise Impact**: Without persistence validation, organizations cannot confidently deploy AI agents for automated presentation workflows, limiting the democratization of enterprise-grade PowerPoint automation.
