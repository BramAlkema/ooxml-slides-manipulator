# AI Template Intelligence - Feature Requirements

## Overview

**Feature Name**: AI Template Intelligence  
**Target Release**: Q4 2025  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort Estimate**: 6-8 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Extension Framework, OOXML JSON Service, Cloud Run deployment  

## Problem Statement

Currently, AI agents and developers must manually select appropriate slide layouts, themes, and templates for presentations. This creates friction in automation workflows and often results in suboptimal visual designs. There's no intelligent system to automatically suggest, select, or adapt templates based on content analysis, brand requirements, or user intent.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- **Template Selection Accuracy**: 85% of auto-selected templates are rated as appropriate by users
- **AI Agent Adoption**: 50+ AI agents successfully using template intelligence features
- **Processing Speed**: Template analysis and selection completed in <2 seconds
- **Brand Compliance**: 95% of auto-selected templates maintain brand guideline compliance

### Secondary Success Metrics  
- **Developer Productivity**: 40% reduction in template-related development time
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ rating for template intelligence features
- **API Usage**: 1000+ template intelligence API calls per month within 3 months of release
