# Architectural and Technical Decisions: OOXML API Extension Platform

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: API Extension Platform vs. Standalone Tool
**Date**: Project Inception (2024)  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Decision**: Build a platform that extends Google Slides API rather than a standalone OOXML manipulation tool

#### Context
Google Slides API has fundamental limitations that prevent advanced presentation operations:
- Cannot replace hardcoded colors with template colors
- No global search/replace across presentation elements  
- Cannot access OOXML theme elements (gradients, effects, custom shapes)
- Limited batch processing capabilities
- No support for advanced table styling or custom XML parts

#### Options Considered
1. **Standalone OOXML Tool**: Independent presentation manipulation service
2. **Google Slides Plugin**: Browser extension or add-on approach
3. **API Extension Platform**: Cloud service that extends Google Slides API capabilities
4. **Desktop Application**: Local software for OOXML manipulation

#### Decision Rationale
- **API Integration**: Works with existing Google Slides workflow, not against it
- **Universal Access**: Makes complex OOXML operations accessible through simple APIs
- **No XML Expertise Required**: Developers can use advanced features without OOXML knowledge
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based platform handles enterprise-scale operations

#### Implementation
```javascript
// Core OOXML processing through XML manipulation
class OOXMLCore {
  extractFiles(blob) { /* ZIP extraction */ }
  replaceFiles(files) { /* XML processing */ }
  generateBlob() { /* ZIP compression */ }
}
```

#### Impact
- ✅ Enables advanced theme and branding operations
- ✅ Universal format support (pptx, docx, xlsx)
- ⚠️ Increased complexity compared to native APIs
- ⚠️ Requires deep OOXML format knowledge

---

### Decision 2: Google Slides ↔ OOXML Bridge Architecture  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Decision**: Implement Cloud Run service that bridges Google Slides and OOXML manipulation

#### Context
Google Apps Script cannot handle OOXML ZIP operations properly. Need architecture that:
- Reads from Google Slides → Converts to OOXML → Manipulates → Converts back → Writes to Google Slides
- Supports operations Google Slides API cannot perform
- Handles large files and batch operations
- Provides simple APIs for complex OOXML transformations

#### Options Considered
1. **Client-side OOXML**: All processing in Google Apps Script (impossible due to ZIP limitations)
2. **Cloud Functions Only**: Simple ZIP/unzip without advanced operations
3. **Cloud Run Bridge**: Full OOXML manipulation with Google Slides integration
4. **Third-party Services**: External OOXML processing (vendor lock-in concerns)

#### Decision Rationale
- **Google Slides Integration**: Seamless roundtrip through Google Slides API
- **Hidden Feature Access**: Exposes OOXML capabilities Google Slides API doesn't provide
- **Universal Operations**: Global search/replace, template operations, theme control

#### Implementation
```javascript
// JSON manifest system
const manifest = {
  xml: { "ppt/slides/slide1.xml": "<xml content>" },
  binary: { "ppt/media/image1.png": "gs://bucket/session/file.png" },
  operations: ["replaceText", "upsertPart", "removePart"]
};
```

#### Impact
- ✅ Supports 100MB+ presentations

**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Decision**: Build framework for universal OOXML operations rather than fixed set of features

#### Context
Users need to perform diverse OOXML operations that Google Slides API cannot do:
- Template operations (color schemes, font replacement, language localization)
- Global transformations (search/replace across all elements)
- Custom OOXML upserts (advanced table styles, custom shapes, metadata)
- Batch operations (consistent transformations across presentation libraries)

#### Options Considered
1. **Fixed Operations**: Predefined set of common OOXML operations
2. **Configuration-Based**: Operations defined through configuration files
3. **Universal Framework**: Flexible system for defining any OOXML operation
4. **Code Generation**: Generate operations from OOXML specifications

#### Decision Rationale
- **Extensibility**: Users can create operations for their specific needs
- **API Coverage**: Framework can expose any OOXML capability as an API
- **Future-Proof**: New OOXML features can be integrated without platform changes
- **Developer Experience**: Simple APIs hide complex OOXML manipulation

#### Implementation
```javascript
// Extension framework pattern
class BaseExtension {
  constructor(context, options) { /* base functionality */ }
  async execute(input) { /* extension logic */ }
}

ExtensionFramework.register('BrandColors', BrandColorsExtension, {
  type: 'THEME',
  version: '1.0.0'
});
```

#### Impact
- ✅ Enables rapid development of custom features
